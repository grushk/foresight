            <div class="pageTitle">Summer Internship in Technology Transfer</div>
            <p>Foresight Science & Technology (www.foresightst.com) is recruiting interns for our summer internship in commercializing technology. Foresight is a leading global vendor of technology transfer and commercialization services. The internship is at our Providence, RI office from July 8 through August 23. We are recruiting seven interns.</p>
            <p>Interns will learn about stakeholders in technology transfer such as standards bodies, venture capitalists and angels, SMEs and large companies, government and non-profit laboratories, technology roadmaps, and royalty rates globally. As part of your duties you will be contacting individuals in these entities and updating information about them in Foresight’s T2+2® databases, which are used by universities and laboratories globally to improve the efficiency and outcome of their commercialization work. You will also be writing short articles on topics relating to the stakeholders you are working on. For example, a person working on the venture capital and angel database will update or write two, o articles, for example: “What makes a good business plan for an early stage technology.” The information will be culled from web research, interviews with experts on the company’s staff, and speaking with a few venture capitalists and people running government venture funds. You will also be involved in team discussions on projects relating to your stakeholder group.</p>
            <p>The work in the Foresight program is demanding. You are expected to perform, and will be treated as, a professional. We expect “A” quality work in everything you do. If you are looking for a 9 to 5 punch the card and go out and party each night summer, this is not the place for you. If you want to know what it is like to work in a culture of excellence, learn a lot, and have fun doing it, this is the place for you.</p>
            <p>The rewards match the demanding nature of the work. You get to learn about technology transfer and commercialization from the people, literally, who wrote the book, helped develop the field, and remain leaders today. You begin by reading our own line tutorial, COM101™ and watching CEO Phyl Speser’s home videos on how to do technology transfer. You will be trained on why we are collecting this data, what we want to know and how it used, who it is disseminated to, and how we collect and validate data. Each week we hold a pizza lunch for our interns and staff at which we discuss an area of our work, how we do it, how the data they are collecting and short articles they are writing fit into it, and how we might improve data collection and its use. In addition we provide a living stipend and a dormitory for those wanting housing. You end up with 2 publications for your resume in addition to getting your Commercialization Research Assistant Certificate at the end of successful completion of our internship program.</p>
            <p>To apply, please send a resume, a writing sample, and three references. References must be professors, employers, or coaches. Please send your application materials to Paula Williams at paula.williams @  Foresightst.com; +1.401.273.4844, ext. 10; Skype: paula.wiliams.fs. Ms. Williams also is available to answer any questions.</p>
